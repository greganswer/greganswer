### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer from Toronto specializing in Rails, React, and AWS. I have a decade of experience from starting my own software company, to freelancing, to Engineering Team Lead.

I'm not satisfied until my code is clean, readable, and maintainable. I strive towards delivering the most impact with the least input. This level of efficiency helps to ensure user satisfaction as well as developer satisfaction.
